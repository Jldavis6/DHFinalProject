# DHFinalProject

This is my final project for Intro to the Digital Humanities with Python. I decided against putting the notebook in as an interactive GitHub Page, since there are around 250 code cells in it, and it takes about 10-15 minutes to run fully. As such, I'm including the link to the Colab notebook, in addition to the link to my deeper dive, which is an essay on the functionality and theoretical possibilities of BERT.

Deep dive: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KIoNLb1pmxWA0YwrQ_fQMG_bxRjaXS06kumzVQRE1Ms/edit?usp=sharing

There are two CSV files needed for the running of the notebook; they are attached in this repository.
